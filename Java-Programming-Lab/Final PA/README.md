# JAVA Programming Lab Final PA : SKKU Library System

## Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive library management system using Java Swing. The system allows users to borrow and return books, manage user accounts, and handle administrative tasks. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, incorporating various advanced Java programming concepts.

## Objective
- **Implement a Library Management System**: Develop a Java application that manages book borrowing/return, user authentication, announcements, and administrative functions.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Use Java Swing for the GUI.
  - Implement multi-threading for background processing.
  - Utilize inheritance and polymorphism for class design.
  - Ensure robust file I/O operations for data persistence.

## Key Features

### Functionalities
- **User Authentication**: 
  - Log in and sign up functionalities.
  - Admin and regular user roles with different permissions.
- **Book Management**:
  - Search, borrow, and return books.
  - Add new books (admin only).
- **Announcements**:
  - View announcements.
  - Add, edit, and delete announcements (admin only).
- **Profile Management**:
  - View user profile and borrowed books.
- **Data Persistence**:
  - Save and load user and book data from text files.

### User Interface
- **Main Page**: Displays announcements and new book arrivals.
- **Search Page**: Allows users to search for books.
- **Profile Page**: Shows user details and borrowed books.
- **Admin Page**: Provides functionalities to manage books and announcements.
- **Dialogs**:
