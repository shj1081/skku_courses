- Reading the Text Document: The program will read the contents of a text document.

- Conversion to Lowercase: Each word in the document will be converted to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparisons.

- Extracting Bigrams: The program will extract sequences of two consecutive words (bigrams) from the text.

- Hashing Bigrams: Each bigram will be hashed into s buckets. A simple hash function can be used for this purpose.

- Storing Bigrams in Hash Buckets: Each bucket will contain a linked list to handle collisions in the hash table. The linked list will store the bigram and its frequency.

- Scanning Each Hash Bucket: The program will iterate through each bucket to collect all bigrams and their frequencies.

- Sorting Bigrams by Frequency: All extracted bigrams will be sorted based on their frequencies.

- Output: Finally, the program will output the bigrams in sorted order along with their frequencies.
