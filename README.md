# Algorithms Project Assignments 
This repository contains implementations of several algorithms assignments from introduction to algorithms, each organized into separate folders. Each assignment folder includes its implementation files and documentation, meeting course requirements and coding standards.

# Projects Included
## PA1 : Min-Max-Median Priority Queue
- **Objective:** Implement a Min-Max-Median Priority Queue in C.
- **Grade:** Full score (16/10) - additional credit received.
- **Key Features:** Efficiently manages integer elements with operations like insert, delete, and find.


## PA2 : k-DNA Sequence Alignment
- **Objective:** Implement dynamic programming for aligning k DNA sequences (upto 5 dna sequences of maximum length 120).
- **Grade:** Full score (10/10).
- **Key Features:** Uses a four-letter alphabet (A, T, G, C) and outputs alignment results to `hw2_output.txt`.


## PA3 : Dynamic Minimum Spanning Tree
- **Objective:** Implement an algorithm to dynamically maintain the minimum spanning tree (MST) of an initially empty undirected graph.
- **Grade:** Full score (16/10) - additional credit received.
- **Key Features:** Handles operations like insertEdge, findMST, deleteEdge, and changeWeight efficiently.
