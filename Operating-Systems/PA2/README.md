# OS PA2 : CPU Scheduling

## Objective

- Linux CFS scheduler to ensure runtime increases in accordance with process priority
- `ps` system call to output relevant scheduling information

## Tasks

### 1. Implement CFS on xv6

- **Select process with minimum virtual runtime**: The process with the lowest virtual runtime is scheduled next.
- **Update runtime/vruntime for each timer interrupt**: Adjust these values proportionally based on process weight.
- **Enforce CPU yield**: When a task runs beyond its allocated time slice, it should yield the CPU.
- **Define and use weight for nice values**: Implement weights ranging from 0 to 39, with a default value of 20 (weight of 1024).
- **Time slice calculation**: Use the formula provided for accurate time slice allocation.
- **Handle newly forked and woken processes**:
  - A forked process inherits the parent's runtime, vruntime, and nice value.
  - A woken processâ€™s vruntime is adjusted to maintain fairness.

### 2. Modify the ps System Call

- Output necessary process information:
- runtime/weight
- runtime
- vruntime
- total tick
- Use millitick unit: Represent the runtime and vruntime in milliticks (tick * 1000).
- Avoid floating-point operations: Use integer arithmetic for all calculations.

## `ps` System Call example

```
name    pid    state    priority    runtime/weight   runtime    vruntime    tick
init    1      SLEEPING 5           0                4000       2000        5480000
sh      2      SLEEPING 5           0                1000       0           5480000
mytest  4      RUNNABLE 5           28               832000     38770       5480000
mytest  5      RUNNING  0           37               3370000    38755       5480000
```
