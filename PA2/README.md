# Algorithm PA2 : k-DNA Sequence Alignment

## Grade
full score (10/10)  
Upto 5 DNA sequences can be aligned using dynamic programming to find the best sequence alignment within 3 seconds.

## 1. Objective
Algorithm to implement multiple sequence alignment with k DNA sequences using Dynamic Programming.
 
## 2. TODO
 - four-letter alphabet {Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C)}
 - measure the similarity of genetic sequences by the frequency of the exactly matched alphabets
 - align the k sequences, but we are permitted to insert gaps in either any sequence
 - C programming language to print out the sequence alignment result into the output file named ‘hw2_output.txt after finding the best sequence alignment from k DNA sequences in the input file named ‘hw2_input.txt’

## 3. Input file format
 - first part : the number (k) of DNA sequences to be aligned
 - second part : the k DNA sequences to be aligned (each sequence appears on a separate line of text)
 - Each part is separated from the next part by a character $
 -  2 ≤ k ≤ 5, and 1 ≤ n ≤ 120 where n is the maximum length of each DNA sequence

## 4. Output file format
 - the sequence alignment results with marks representing matched alphabets
 - In the last line, mark “*” on the columns containing identical alphabets across all sequences

## Example of input / output file
```
[Input file: hw2_input.txt]

$
ATTGCCATT
ATGGCCATT 
ATCCAAT

[Output file: hw2_output.txt] 
ATTGCCA-TT
ATGGCCA-TT
AT--CCAAT-
**  *** * 
```

## Grading Criteria
 - the number of identical alphabets across all sequences returned by your submitted program
 - the actual running time
 - well-written document to explain your source code and the performance analysis of your algorithm
