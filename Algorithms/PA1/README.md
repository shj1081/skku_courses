# Algorithm PA1 : Min-Max-Median Priority Queue

## Grade
full score (16/10) - additional credit received  
Min-Max-Median Priority Queue can extract the minimum, maximum, and median elements in O(log n) time complexity.

## 1. Objective
Your task is to implement a Min-Max-Median Priority Queue in C. 
Design a robust data structure that can efficiently find the minimum, maximum, and median integer elements.
When the number of elements is even, the median is defined as the smaller of the two middle elements.

## 2. Required Functions

Implement the following functions:

* `void insert(int element)`: Inserts an integer element into the priority queue.

* `int delete_min()`: Deletes and returns the minimum element.

* `int delete_max()`: Deletes and returns the maximum element.

* `int delete_median()`: Deletes and returns the median element.

* `int find_min()`: Fetches but does not remove the minimum element.

* `int find_max()`: Fetches but does not remove the maximum element.

* `int find_median()`: Fetches but does not remove the median element.

## 3. Input Format and Examples

The input consists of a series of operations. 
The first integer denotes the number of operations to perform (ranging from 1 up to 500,000). 
Each subsequent line describes an operation, starting with a character indicating the operation type (I for insert, D for delete, F for find) followed by a character specifying the target (M for min, X for max, E for median), and if inserting, the integer to insert.

```
Example Input:
8
I 5
I 10
I 20
I 15
D M
F M
F X
F E

Expected Output:
10
20
15
```

## 4. Grading Criteria
1. The correctness of the results generated by your code.
2. The efficiency of your algorithm, considering its actual runtime.
3. The clarity and detail in your accompanying documentation, which should explain your source code and provide a performance analysis of your algorithm
